You are identifying causal or strongly correlative relationships between predefined nodes. Use the methodology, results, and discussion sections to justify edges.

Final nodes to consider:
{final_nodes}

Paper sections:
--- Methodology ---
{methodology_text}
--- Results ---
{results_text}
--- Discussion ---
{discussion_text}

Output requirements:
[
  {
    "source": "node name exactly as provided",
    "target": "node name exactly as provided",
    "relation": "increases|decreases|causes|positively correlates with|negatively correlates with",
    "evidence": "quoted or paraphrased sentence",
    "section": "methodology|results|discussion"
  }
]

Rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON array with no commentary.
- Limit to relationships among the provided nodes; do not introduce new nodes.
- Each edge must be directional and match one of the allowed relation labels.
- Provide 3‑8 edges per run; avoid duplicates within the same response.

Example response:
[
  {
    "source": "post-draw alignment",
    "target": "fiber tensile strength",
    "relation": "increases",
    "evidence": "Post-drawn fibers exhibited higher tensile strength due to improved chain orientation.",
    "section": "results"
  }
]
