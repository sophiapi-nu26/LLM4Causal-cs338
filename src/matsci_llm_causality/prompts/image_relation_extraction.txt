You are an expert in materials science. Your task is to extract relationships from the given image  
                Instructions:  
                1. Identify all relevant variables in the text. Each variable must be categorized as exactly one of:  
                - material  
                - structure  
                - process  
                - property  

                2. Identify relationships between variables. Only use the following relationship types:  
                - increases  
                - decreases  
                - positively correlates with  
                - negatively correlates with  
                - causes  

                3. Express each relationship as a structured statement with the format:  
                [Variable A <Type>] [relationship type] [Variable B <Type>]  

                4. Be precise and consistent:  
                - Use the exact wording of the variables as they appear in the text (do not paraphrase).  
                - Output one whole relationship per line. Do not number them. Relationships only.
                - Do not include explanations, summaries, or extra text outside the structured statements.
