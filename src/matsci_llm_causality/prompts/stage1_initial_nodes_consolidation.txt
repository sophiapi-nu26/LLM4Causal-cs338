You are consolidating node proposals from multiple reviewers. Each reviewer returned a JSON array of nodes. Your task is to merge them into a single canonical list.

Input node proposals:
{raw_node_lists}

Output requirements (return valid JSON exactly in this format):
[
  {
    "name": "canonical node name",
    "type": "material|structure|process|property",
    "summary": "short justification combining the reviewers' insights",
    "sources": ["Reviewer 1 node name", "Reviewer 3 node name"]
  }
]

Rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON array with no commentary.
- The value of "type" MUST be exactly one of: material, structure, process, property (lowercase). If a reviewer supplied "other", pick the best-fitting category or rewrite the node.
- Merge overlapping nodes even if names differ slightly; include their original names in "sources".
- Preserve 3‑8 of the most central nodes.
- Keep summaries concise (max 2 sentences).

Example response:
[
  {
    "name": "recombinant spidroins",
    "type": "material",
    "summary": "High-molecular-weight proteins assembled via split inteins to mimic native silk components.",
    "sources": ["recombinant spidroins", "microbial spidroins"]
  },
  {
    "name": "dragline silk mechanics",
    "type": "property",
    "summary": "Target strength and toughness benchmarks for the synthetic fibers.",
    "sources": ["dragline silk mechanical properties", "fiber mechanics"]
  }
]
