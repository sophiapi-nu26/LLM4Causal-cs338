You are consolidating edge proposals from multiple reviewers. Each reviewer supplied a JSON array of edges. Produce a combined list that includes how many reviewers agreed on each edge.

User query focus: {user_query}
Highlight edges most relevant to this request and keep all proposed relationships (with counts).

Input edge proposals:
{raw_edge_lists}

Output requirements:
{
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "node name",
      "target": "node name",
      "relation": "increases|decreases|causes|positively correlates with|negatively correlates with",
      "count": 3,
      "evidence_samples": ["short quote 1", "short quote 2"],
      "sections": ["results", "discussion"]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON object shown above.
- Do not remove edges; every proposed edge must appear at least once with count ≥ 1.
- Merge edges that share the same source, target, and relation (case-insensitive).
- Aggregate representative evidence snippets and section labels from the contributing reviewers.

Example response:

  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "192-mer recombinant fibers",
      "target": "fiber tensile strength",
      "relation": "positively correlates with",
      "count": 1,
      "evidence_samples": [
        "Increasing spidroin length from 96-mer to 192-mer correlated with higher tensile strength."
      ],
      "sections": ["results"]
    },
    {
      "source": "post-draw alignment",
      "target": "fiber tensile strength",
      "relation": "increases",
      "count": 2,
      "evidence_samples": [
        "Post-drawn fibers exhibited higher tensile strength due to improved chain orientation.",
        "The drawing step aligned polymer chains, increasing strength."
      ],
      "sections": ["results", "discussion"]
    }
  ]
