You are expanding an existing set of nodes using the paper's results section. Use the provided initial nodes as anchors and propose a richer list.

Initial nodes:
{initial_nodes}

Results section:
{results_text}

Output requirements (return valid JSON exactly in this format):
[
  {
    "name": "new or refined node name",
    "type": "material|structure|process|property",
    "summary": "one sentence describing the node's role",
    "related_initial_nodes": ["name A", "name B"]
  }
]

Rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON array with no additional commentary.
- Provide 5‑10 nodes that add nuance to the initial list.
- The value of "type" MUST be exactly one of: material, structure, process, property (lowercase). Reclassify ambiguous cases to the closest category.
- Relate each node to at least one initial node using the provided names.
- Do not repeat identical nodes; refine names instead.

Example response:
[
  {
    "name": "192-mer spidroin fibers",
    "type": "material",
    "summary": "Highest molecular-weight fibers exhibiting near-natural strength.",
    "related_initial_nodes": ["recombinant spidroins"]
  },
  {
    "name": "post-draw alignment process",
    "type": "process",
    "summary": "Stretching step that aligns chains to boost mechanical performance.",
    "related_initial_nodes": ["dragline silk mechanics", "recombinant spidroins"]
  }
]
