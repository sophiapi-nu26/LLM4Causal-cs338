You are an expert scientific reader. Analyze the abstract below and return ONLY a JSON array describing the most central nodes (concepts, variables, or entities) in the paper.

Output requirements (return valid JSON exactly in this format):
[
  {
    "name": "concise node name",
    "type": "material|structure|process|property",
    "summary": "one sentence describing why this node matters"
  }
]

Rules:
- Return the array directly with no preamble or commentary.
- The value of "type" MUST be exactly one of: material, structure, process, property (lowercase).
- Include 3‑6 nodes that capture the core story of the abstract.
- Use consistent casing for node names.
- Do not invent information that is not in the abstract.

Example response:
[
  {
    "name": "recombinant spidroins",
    "type": "material",
    "summary": "High-molecular-weight proteins produced microbially that mimic native spider silk components."
  },
  {
    "name": "dragline silk mechanical properties",
    "type": "property",
    "summary": "Performance benchmarks the synthetic fibers aim to match."
  }
]

Abstract:
