You are an expert in materials science entity consolidation. Your task is to identify which entities from the list below refer to the same concept and should be consolidated.

Entity List:
{entity_list}

Instructions:
1. Identify groups of entities that refer to the same concept (e.g., "temperature" and "thermal conditions")
2. For each group, choose the most canonical/precise name
3. Output ONLY valid JSON format - no other text

Required JSON format:
{{
    "consolidated_entities": [
        {{
            "canonical_name": "temperature",
            "entity_type": "property",
            "variations": ["temperature", "thermal conditions", "heat"]
        }},
        {{
            "canonical_name": "crystallinity",
            "entity_type": "property", 
            "variations": ["crystallinity", "crystal structure"]
        }}
    ]
}}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no explanations or additional text.

Focus on the original text context when making consolidation decisions:
# {text[:500]}...  # Commented out text truncation - uncomment and adjust if needed
{text}
