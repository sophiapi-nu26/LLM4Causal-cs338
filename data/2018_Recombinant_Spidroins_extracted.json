    "methods": "METHODS \nStrains and growth conditions. E. coli NEB 10-beta (NEB10β) was used for all plasmid \ncloning and protein production. For all cloning, E. coli strains were cultured in Terrific Broth \n(TB) containing 24 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L tryptone, 0.4% glycerol, 17 mM KH2PO4, and 72 \nmM K2HPO4 at 37°C with appropriate antibiotics (50 µg/mL kanamycin and 30 µg/mL \nchloramphenicol). M9 glucose medium with tryptone supplement (2% Glucose, 1x M9 Salts, 75 \nmM MOPS pH 7.4, 12 g/L tryptone, 5 mM Citrate, 2 mM MgSO4∙7H2O, 100 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, \n100 µM CaCl2∙2H2O, 3 µM thiamine, 1x micronutrients [40 µM ZnSO4∙7H2O, 20 µM \nCuSO4∙5H2O, 10 µM MnCl2∙4H2O, 4 µM H3BO3, 0.4 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O, and 0.3 µM \nCoCl2∙6H2O]) was used for protein production in bioreactors. \nChemicals and reagents. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were \nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Plasmid purification and gel extraction kits \n\nwere purchased from iNtRON Biotechnology (Lynnwood, WA, USA). FastDigest restriction \nenzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, \nUSA) and used for all digestions and ligations following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. \nGenetic assembly of 64- and 96-mer spidroins. The repeated spidroin DNA sequences \nwere constructed using a method modified from previous work (Supplementary Figure 2). The \ncoding sequence of 1-mer N. clavipes MaSp1 was obtained from Tianjin Institute of Industrial \nBiotechnology (Supplementary Table 1) and chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA \nTechnologies (San Jose, CA, USA). This DNA sequence was flanked on the 5' end by restriction \nsites 5'-KpnI/NheI-3' and on the 3' end by restriction sites 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3'. The sequence was \ninserted between restriction site KpnI/Kpn2I of a medium copy (pBBR1 replication origin) \nchloramphenicol resistance (CmR) expression vector, resulting in plasmid p1. To begin the \niterative DNA assembly, plasmid p1 was linearized by digestion with NheI and ligated with a \nsecond 1-mer sequence digested by NheI/SpeI. The ligation was transformed to NEB10β for \namplification, yielding plasmid p2 containing 2-mer spidroin. The same procedure was repeated \nfor p2, with insertion of a linearized 2-mer sequence, to yield plasmid p4. The process was \nrepeated until p64 (32-mer + 32-mer) and p96 (64-mer + 32-mer) were obtained. Because the \nannealing of the NheI and SpeI complementary overhangs from joining fragments does not \nproduce a new restriction site, digestion with NheI was used to confirm the proper orientation of \nthe insert at each step based on fragment sizes. \nConstruction and sequence optimization of silk-SI-fusion proteins. N- and C-terminal \nSI amino acid sequences (CfaN and CfaC, respectively) were obtained from a recent publication. \nSI coding sequences were optimized for E. coli expression along with 5'UTR and RBS sequences \nusing a combination of computational approaches. Specifically, using the Gene Designer 2.0 \n\n(ATUM) software, a variable CfaC coding sequence was flanked on the 3' end by invariable 5'-\nKpnI/NheI-3' restrictions sites and repetitive silk sequences, and on the 5' end by an invariable \nRBS/5'-UTR (5'-ATCAGCAGGACGCACTGACCGAATTCAAAAGATCTTTTAAGAAGGA \nGATATACAT-3'), including the 5'-EcoRI/BglII-3' restriction sites, and short peptide coding \nsequence 5'-ATGGCTAAGACTAAA-3' (for increased translation initiation rate, as described \npreviously; Supplementary Table 1). Considering these flanking invariable sequences, the \nvariable CfaC sequence was optimized using a modified E. coli codon usage table and giving \nextra weight to 5' mRNA structure minimization during sequence optimization. The resulting \nsequence (Supplementary Table 1) containing the 5'UTR and CfaC was synthesized as a gblock \nfragment by Integrated DNA Technologies and was inserted 5' of the 64-mer or 96-mer \nsequences by digestion/ligation with BglII/KpnI to yield plasmids pC64x and pC96x, which \nencode fusion proteins C64 and C96, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the \nvariable CfaN sequence was flanked on the 5' end by invariable 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3' restrictions sites \nand on the 3' end by an invariable 5'-BamHI/XhoI-3' site and subjected to the same optimization \nprocess as CfaC. The resulting CfaN sequence was synthesized and inserted 3' of the 64-mer and \n96-mer sequences by digestion/ligation with Kpn2I/BamHI to yield plasmids p64N and p96N, \nwhich encode fusion proteins 64N and 96N, respectively. The resulting constructs allow for easy \nswapping of any IntC of interest by digestion with BglII/KpnI and any IntN of interest by \ndigestion with Kpn2I/BamHI, while the presence of NheI/SpeI sites allows for iterative genetic \nassembly of any large or other repetitive material proteins of interest (Supplementary Figure 1). \nUpregulation of GlyV tRNA production. In addition to sequence optimizations, cellular \nglycyltRNA levels were also upregulated to meet the high demands on glycyltRNA posed by \nspidroin overexpression. The glyV tRNA coding sequence and its native promoter were PCR-\n\namplified from the NEB10β genomic DNA (Supplementary Table 1) and cloned between \nAatII/XhoI sites of a medium copy vector carrying p15A replication origin and Kanamycin \nresistance (KanR), yielding plasmid pGlyV (Supplementary Table 2). For all spidroin expression, \npGlyV was co-transformed with the spidroin plasmid. \nShake flask cultures. For initial ligation tests as shown in Supplementary Figures 2 & 4, \nprotein production was carried out in shake flasks. Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 \nmL TB medium at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. Overnight 50 mL cultures were then inoculated \ninto 500 mL fresh TB medium in Erlenmeyer flasks at an initial OD600 = 0.08. Cultures were \ngrown at 37°C with orbital shaking to OD600 = 6, then induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and \ncultured for an additional 6 hours at 30°C with orbital shaking. \nBioproduction in fed-batch bioreactors. All spidroins were finally produced in 2 L fedbatch bioreactors (Bioflo120, Eppendorf). Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 mL TB \nmedium at 37°C on an orbital shaker. The overnight cultures were then inoculated into 1 L \nglucose M9 medium with tryptone supplement with an initial OD600 = 0.08. After overnight \nincubation at 37°C with orbital shaking, 1 L cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g \nfor 10 min and resuspended in 300 mL sterile resuspension medium (250 mM MOPS pH 7.4, \n2.5% glucose, 60 g/L tryptone, 25 mM citrate, 10 mM MgSO4, 500 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, 15 µM \nthiamine, 5x micronutrients). The resuspended cultures were then added to an autoclaved 2 L \nBioflo120 heat-blanketed bioreactor containing 1.2 L water and 1.15x M9 salts. Sterile \nCaCl2∙2H2O was added to a final concertation of 100 µM. Antifoam 204 was added as needed to \nminimize foaming (approximately 0.01%). Agitation and air flow was regulated to maintain \napproximately 70% dissolved oxygen (DO). After consumption of the initial 0.5% glucose (as \njudged by ΔDO), a sterile substrate feed (20% glucose, 48 g/L tryptone, and 10 g/L \n\nMgSO4∙7H2O) was initiated to maintain a linear growth rate. Reactors were induced at OD600 = \n80 by addition of 1 mM IPTG and culture temperature was reduced to 30°C. Cultures were \ncollected four hours after induction. Titers were estimated from densitometric analysis of \nCoomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Figure 3). \nProtein ligation. Cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g for 30 min. \nPellets from complimentary SI-fused spidroins (e.g. 96N and C96 or 64N and C64) were combined \nat a 1:1 reactant ratio based on densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE \ngels. Mixed pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS pH \n7.4, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF) and sonicated using a QSonica Q700 sonicator (Qsonica, \nNewton, CT, USA) for 10 min. Sonicated resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation at \n25,000 x g for 30 min to remove supernatants. Pellets were resuspended in ligation buffer (8 M \nurea, 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP) and stirred at 37°C for 24 h to \ndissolve SI-fused spidroins and allow maximal ligation yield. The mixtures were then \ncentrifuged at 25,000 x g for 1 h to remove cell debris and undissolved proteins. \nProtein purification. The purification protocol was modified from previous methods. \nSpecifically, ligated spidroins in ligation buffer were acidified with acetic acid to pH 4.0. \nAmmonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 1.2 M. The mixture was then \ncentrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and additional ammonia sulfate \nwas added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2.3 M. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture \nwas centrifuged again at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet \nwas resuspended in SEC buffer (8 M urea, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 10) for further \npurification by size-exclusion chromatography. SEC purifications were performed on an AKTA \nPure Chromatography System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-\n\n500 HR column (for 128-mer and 192-mer) or a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column (for \n96-mer). Proteins were separated using an isocratic elution with SEC buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 \nmL/min. Fractions containing greater than 90% ligation product, as determined by SDS-PAGE \ngel densitometry, were collected. SEC-purified fractions were combined and dialyzed in 10K \nMWCO SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientific) against 10 mM acetic acid aqueous \nsolution. The dialyzed samples were then lyophilized. \nLigation kinetics analysis. For kinetics analysis, 64-mer protein concentrations in crude \nlysates were estimated by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. \nBased on estimated concentrations, fully sonicated resuspensions of 64C and N64 in ligation \nbuffer were combined to give final concentrations of 100 µM for both 64C and N64 in a final \nvolume of 500 µL. Combined resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, and pellets were \nresuspended in 500 µL of desired test buffer pre-incubated at the desired test temperature. \nReactions were quenched by transferring 5 µL of reaction to 95 µL of Laemmli sample buffer \npreheated to 100°C and continuing boiling for 10 min. \nSDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis. All SDS-PAGE gels were 1 mm thick, \ndiscontinuous with 3% stacking gel, and hand cast at the indicated percentages. Samples were \nprepared at 1 mg/mL or 5 µM total protein in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, \n60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 100 µM DTT). Gels were run on MiniPROTEAN Tetra Cells (Bio-Rad) in 1x Tris-glycine SDS buffer (25 mM Tris base, 250 mM \nglycine, 0.1% SDS), until just before the dye front exited the gel. Gels were stained in \nCoomassie Blue solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1 g/L Coomassie Brilliant Blue) for a \nminimum of one hour at room temperature with gentle agitation and destained in Coomassie \nBlue destain buffer (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for a minimum of 1 hour. Gels were \n\nimaged on an Azure c600 Imager (Azure Biosystems). All densitometry analysis was performed \nwith the AzureSpot Analysis Software (Azure Biosystems). Images were background subtracted \nwith an automatic valley-to-valley baseline detection. Protein band intensities were integrated by \nthe software. Ligation yield was calculated as the intensity of the product band over the sum of \nboth reactant and product band intensities. Spidroin titer was calculated as the intensity of the \nspidroin band over the sum of all band intensities multiplied by 150 mg/L/OD600 and cell density \nat OD600. (150 mg/L/OD600 is the typical total protein titer in DH10β E. coli cells). \nFiber spinning and mechanical testing. Fiber spinning and mechanical testing were \nperformed following a protocol modified from previous methods. Lyophilized spidroin powders \nwere dissolved in hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to 14% w/v. This protein dope was loaded to a \n100 µL Hamilton gastight syringe (Hamilton Robotics) fitted with a 23s gauge (116 µm inner \ndiameter, 1.71 inch length) needle. The syringe was fitted to a Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite \nsyringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), and the dope was extruded into a 95% methanol bath at 5 \nµL/min (approximately 0.5 m fiber/min). Extruded fibers were then transferred to a 75% \nmethanol bath and carefully extended at approximately 1 cm/s to the maximum draw ratio \nwithout fiber fracture (6x for 96-mer fibers, 9x for 128- and 192-mer fibers). Extended fibers \nwere removed from the bath and held under tension until visibly dry. Segments of post-drawn \nfibers (20 mm) were carefully laid exactly vertical across a 5 mm square opening cut into a 20 \nmm square piece of cardstock and fixed with adhesive tape at both ends of the opening. \nDiameters of mounted fibers were then measured by light microscopy, averaging measurements \nat three points along the fiber axis. Mechanical properties were measured by axial pull tests on \nan MTS Criterion Model 41 universal test frame fitted with a 1N load cell (MTS Systems \nCorporation). Cardstock holders were mounted between two opposing spring-loaded grips, and \n\nthe supporting edges were carefully cut. Pull tests were conducted with a constant crosshead \nspeed of 10 mm/min. Stress-strain curves were recorded by the MTS TW Elite test suite at a \nsampling rate of 50 Hz. Fiber breaks were recorded when a 90% drop from peak stress was \ndetected. All mechanical properties were automatically calculated by the MTS TW Elite test \nsuite. Ultimate tensile strength was calculated as the maximum measured load over the initial \nfiber cross-sectional area (𝐴𝐴= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2), as determined from measured initial diameters. Modulus \nwas calculated as the slope of a linear least squares fit to the stress/strain data of the initial elastic \nregion. Toughness was calculated as the area under the total stress/strain curve divided by the \ninitial fiber volume (𝑉𝑉= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2ℎ) as calculated from measured initial fiber diameters and set initial \ngage length of 5 mm. For each protein, a total of 14 fibers were measured in this manner. \nLight microscopy. Fiber diameters were measured using images acquired with a Zeiss \nAxio Observer ZI Inverted Microscope equipped with a 20x objective lens and the Axiovision \nLE software (Zeiss). For morphological analysis and further confirmation of fiber diameters, \nadditional images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TiE Inverted Microscope equipped with a \n60x objective and analyzed using the Nis-Elements software (Nikon). \nScanning Electron Microscopy. Following tensile tests, silk fibers were mounted onto a \nsample holder using conductive tape. The sample holder was sputter coated with a 10 nm gold \nlayer using a Leica EM ACE600 high vacuum sputter coater (Leica Microsystems). Fibers were \nimaged using a Nova NanoSEM 230 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI) at \nan accelerating voltage of 7-10 kV. Fiber circularity was calculated from cross-sectional areas \nand perimeters as 4𝜋𝜋(\n𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2), where a perfect circle gives a value of 1. \nPolarized Raman microspectroscopy. Silk fibers were carefully fixed to glass \nmicroscope slides with microscale markings to ensure that spectra were acquired at the same \n\nlocation before and after stage rotation. Raman spectra were acquired with a Renishaw RM1000 \nInVia Confocal Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw) coupled to a Leica DM LM microscope with \nrotating stage (Leica Microsystems). Silk fibers were initially oriented along the x-axis as \ndepicted in Supplementary Figure 9. Fibers were irradiated at a fixed point with the 514 nm line \nof an argon laser with polarization fixed along the x-axis and focused through a 50x objective \n(NA = 0.75). Spectra were recorded from 1150-1750 cm-1 with an 1800 lines/mm grating. For \neach acquisition, a total of 16 spectra were accumulated, each for 10 s. The stage was then \nrotated to orient fibers along the y-axis with the same laser polarization, and spectra were \nacquired a second time at the same fixed point. No signs of thermal degradation were apparent \neither visually or within recorded spectra. All recorded spectra were analyzed using the Fityk \n0.9.8 software. Baselines were subtracted from all spectra using the built-in Fityk convex hull \nalgorithm. For secondary structure determination, the amide I peak of y-axis oriented fibers was \ndeconvolved into a set of five gaussian peaks centered at 1641, 1656, 1670, 1685, and 1700 cm-1 \nfor unordered, 31-Helix, β-Sheet, β-Turn, and β-Turn components, respectively, as previously \nreported. Peak areas were integrated and percentages were calculated as the component peak area \nover the sum of all peak areas. Percentages were averaged from measurements of three fibers. \nFor intensity ratio calculations, all spectra were normalized to the intensity of the 1450 cm-1 \npeak, which arises from CH2 bending and is insensitive to protein conformation. For each fiber, \nthe normalized intensity at 1670 cm-1 of the peak oriented along the Y-axis was divided by the \nnormalized intensity of the peak oriented along the x-axis to give the intensity ratio (𝐼𝐼\n𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋). This \nprocedure was performed on a total of three separate fibers and calculated intensity ratios were \naveraged. Spectra were also averaged and presented in Figure 3d with standard deviations for \neach point along the spectra. \n\nTensile \nStrength\nYoung's \nModulus\nSpidroin \nMW. \n(kDa)\nToughness \n(MJ/m3) 1\n(MPa) 1\n(GPa) 1\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\n- \n1215 ±\nDragline\nN. clavipes\nDragline \nAverage**\n1 For all mechanical measurements, n = 14. \n428\nBreaking\nDiamete\nr (µm) 1 \nSource\nStrain\n(%)1\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\n\n430\nExtended Data Figure 1.

Our standardized SI-Brick \nDNA assembly system was developed based on five principle design considerations. (1) The \nsystem should allow for in situ iterative, back-to-back, genetic assembly of material protein \nrepeat motifs up to the maximum genetically-permissible size. (2) The system should allow for \nselective swapping of the three standardized protein parts necessary for post-translational, SImediated ligation (i.e. RBS/IntN, assembled material protein, and IntC/stop codon). (3) No \nrestriction sites within the coding sequence should introduce amino acids likely to be \ndetrimental to SI ligation or protein material properties. (4) For maximum convenience, the \nplatform should allow simultaneous \"one-pot\" assembly of all three protein parts. (5) The \nplatform should also allow for selective swapping of the promoter, antibiotic marker, and \nreplication origin. \n \nWe built our SI-Brick system (Supplementary Figure 1) based on existing BglBrick vectors \nwhich have been extensively used to construct multi-enzyme metabolic pathways for metabolic \nengineering.1 The BglBrick vectors employ BglII and BamHI for digestion/ligation. However, the \nBglII and BamHI enzyme pair cannot be used to assemble material protein fragments because \nthe resulting BglII site would introduce an arginine residue between SI and the material protein, \nproximal to the folded SI active site, which may negatively affect SI ligation, violating our design \ncriterium (3). To solve this problem, we further incorporated an additional and orthogonal pair \nof restriction sites NheI and SpeI for iterative assembly of repetitive material protein \nsequences. NheI and SpeI code amino acids Alanine-Serine and Threonine-Serine, respectively, \nwhich should not affect SI ligation. During repetitive silk assembly, the scar sequence from \nNheI/SpeI ligation is ACTAGC, encoding a Threonine-Serine linker that is abundant in the native \nspidroin sequence and does not affect silk properties. Additionally, because existing BglBricks \nvectors already have SpeI for swapping of selection markers, flanking material proteins with \nNheI/SpeI alone would fail to meet criterium (2). Thus, we chose to flank material protein parts \nwith an additional pair of restriction sites (KpnI and Kpn2I), allowing the repetitive proteins to \nbe specifically swapped by enzyme pair KpnI and Kpn2I.\nTo use our SI-Brick DNA assembly system, repeat material protein motifs can be \niteratively assembled through back-to-back digestion/ligation using NheI and SpeI \n(Supplementary Figure 2). The assembled material protein sequence can then be assembled \nwith desired SI parts, promoters, vector backbones using corresponding restriction enzymes in \none step (Supplementary Figure 2e). When needed, assembled repetitive proteins can be \nswapped with other material proteins with KpnI/Kpn2I digestion/ligation. Cfa IntC (including \nstart codon and RBS) can be swapped with other IntC or N-terminal sequences with EcoRI/KpnI \ndigestion/ligation.

Fibers spun \nfrom these synthetic spidroins display ultimate tensile strength (σ), modulus (E), \nextensibility (ε), and toughness (UT) of 1.03 ± 0.11 GPa, 13.7 ± 3.0 GPa, 18 ± 6%, and 114 ± \n51 MJ/m3, respectively—equivalent to the performance of natural N. clavipes dragline silk.6 \nThis work demonstrates for the first time that microbially produced synthetic silk fibers \ncan match the performance of natural silk fibers by all common metrics (σ, E, ε, UT), \nproviding a more dependable source of high-strength fibers to replace natural spider silks \nfor mechanically demanding applications. Furthermore, our biosynthetic platform can be \npotentially expanded for the assembly and production of other protein-based materials \nwith high MW and repetitive sequences that have so far been impossible to synthesize by \ngenetic means alone. \n46\n\nMain Text: \nDragline spidroins are typically very large (200-350 kDa), highly repetitive proteins, \ncontaining hundreds of tandem repeats of glycine and alanine-rich sequences.1,7 As with most \npolymers, the size of these spidroins is expected to positively correlate with tensile strength due \nto an increased density of interchain interactions and entanglements and fewer chain-end \ndefects.8,5 Indeed, previous work has demonstrated a clear correlation between MW and strength \nfor recombinant N. clavipes dragline fibers, with the largest spidroin (96-mer, 285 kDa) yielding \nthe strongest recombinant fiber reported to date (~550 MPa).5 However, despite the apparent \nneed for even larger spidroins to yield natural strength fibers (1.1 GPa for N. clavipes dragline)6, \ndragline spidroins larger than 285 kDa have yet to be produced in quantities sufficient for fiber \ntesting due to major challenges in recombinant production of high MW spidroins (e.g. instability \nof long, highly repetitive DNA/mRNA sequences in heterologous hosts, translation inhibition by \ncomplex mRNA secondary structures, high demands for glycine and alanine tRNAs, overall \nmetabolic burden).5 \n62\n\nFigure 1. Process schematic for split intein-mediated ligation of spider silk proteins with \nunprecedented molecular weight and mechanical properties. (a) The highly repetitive core of \nnatural N. clavipes dragline silk protein MaSp1 (shown as an idealized peptide sequence) is \nreduced to a single repeat unit (1-mer). (b) The 1-mer DNA sequence is combined in silico with \n5' UTR, RBS, and split intein (SI) sequences, which are then computationally optimized for \nmicrobial production. (c) The optimized DNA sequences are assembled through our \nstandardized SI-Brick system to yield complementary IntC- or IntN-flanked 96-mer constructs \nwhich are (d) transformed to E. coli for bioproduction. (e) Cell cultures are mixed and lysed to \ninitiate SI-mediated covalent ligation of 96-mer spidroins to yield a 192-mer, 556 kDa product. \n(f) Ligated product is purified and spun into fibers for mechanical testing. Scale bar indicates 5 \nµm. \n76\nTo confront these challenges, we envisioned using split intein (SI)-mediated reactions to \npost-translationally ligate the largest spidroins that can be stably expressed in engineered \nEscherichia coli (i.e. 96-mer, Fig. 1). SIs are peptide auto processing domains that, when fused \n\nto separately expressed proteins, catalyze spontaneous splicing reactions, covalently linking their \nfusion partners via a peptide bond and leaving only a few residues (6 amino acids in this case) at \nthe ligation site.9 In this context, these residues are unlikely to affect the properties of the much \nlarger ligated spidroins (6720 amino acids). Given the tendency of large silk sequences to form \ninclusion bodies in microbial hosts, we employed a recently engineered SI pair (Cfa) that retains \ncatalytic activity in the presence of 8 M urea, a denaturant often used to extract and solubilize \nspidroins from heterologous hosts.10 Thus, ligating an N-intein fused 96-mer (N96) with a Cintein fused 96-mer (96C) spidroin would yield a 556 kDa, 192-mer spidroin (Fig 1e). \nTo facilitate microbial production of highly repetitive, SI-fused material proteins, we \ndeveloped a standardized DNA assembly strategy, termed SI-Bricks (Supplementary Note 1 and \nFigure 1). The SI-Bricks strategy allows for rapid genetic swapping of the core components of \nthe devised SI-mediated ligation system (e.g. N-inteins, material proteins, C-inteins, and fusion \ndomains/purification tags) in addition to common standardized biological parts (e.g. promoters, \nribosomal binding sites, replication origins, and selection markers), all through simple restriction \nenzyme digestion/ligations. With SI-Bricks, starting from a single codon-optimized repeat unit \n(1-mer) of the N. clavipes dragline spidroin MaSp1, we assembled 64-mer and 96-mer spidroin \nDNA sequences by iterative end-to-end restriction digestion/ligation. The spidroin sequences \nwere then genetically combined with codon-optimized SI DNA sequences and expression parts \n(Supplementary Figure 2). The resulting SI-fused spidroins (N64, 64C, N96, and 96C) were \nindividually expressed in an E. coli host with glycyltRNA levels engineered to meet the demands \nof the most frequently used glycine codons in the spidroin sequences (Methods). Following our \noptimized fermentation conditions (Methods), typical titer of the SI-fused spidroins was nearly 2 \n\ng/L from glucose minimal medium with tryptone supplementation after four hours of production \n(Supplementary Figure 3). \nSpidroin inter- and intramolecular interactions are highly sensitive to salt and pH, even in \nthe presence of 8 M urea, and we expected that unwanted spidroin interactions would lower SI \nligation efficiency. Thus, to test optimum conditions for ligation of SI-fused spidroins, 8 M urea \nextracts of E. coli expressing 64N or C64 were mixed at several salt concentrations, temperatures, \nand pH values (Extended Data Figure 1). Under all tested conditions, SI-mediated spidroin \nligation is both rapid and robust, with the highest ligation yields observed at 37 °C, 300 mM \nNaCl, pH 7. Thus, for all subsequent ligations, these conditions were maintained, giving ligation \nyields of 68% and 62% for 128-mer and 192-mer spidroin, respectively (Extended Figure Data \nFigure 2). Ligation products were separated from most cellular proteins by selective precipitation \nwith ammonium sulfate and further separated from unreacted 64-mer or 96-mer by size \nexclusion chromatography (SEC) for a final product purity ≥90% (Supplementary Fig. 4). As a \nstandard for mechanical properties, a 96-mer spidroin with no SIs was also expressed and \npurified following identical procedures. All purified proteins were lyophilized and dissolved in \nhexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to yield 14% w/v spinning dopes which were wet-spun into solid \nfibers by extrusion into a 95% methanol bath followed by immediate post-spin drawing. \nMechanical testing of post-drawn fibers revealed significant, nearly two-fold increases in \nboth tensile strength (from 525 ± 83 MPa to 1031 ± 111 MPa, P < 0.0001, n=14) and modulus \n(from 7.8 ± 1.3 GPa to 13.7 ± 3.0 GPa, P < 0.0001, n=14) between 96-mer and 192-mer fibers \n(Fig. 2a,b). Average toughness also increased slightly (25%), while average breaking strain \ndecreased slightly (22%), though neither change is statistically significant due to large fiber to \nfiber variations (Fig. 2c, d). For both strength and modulus, 128-mer fibers showed performance \n\nintermediate to 96- and 192-mer fibers. Together, these results strongly suggest that there \nremains a positive correlation between spidroin size and fiber strength and modulus up to a MW \nof at least 556 kDa. Most significantly, these results demonstrate that fibers spun from a \nmicrobially synthesized 192-mer N. clavipes dragline spidroin have mechanical properties \nequivalent to natural N. clavipes dragline silk (i.e., σ = 993 ± 140 GPa, E = 14.0 ± 4.0 GPa, UT = \n111.2 ± 30 MJ/m3, ε = 16.3 ±3.8%, Extended Data Table 1).6,11,12,13 \n131\nFigure 2.

(a) Ultimate \ntensile strength, (b) elastic modulus, (c) breaking strain, and (d) toughness of 96-mer, 128-mer, \nand 192-mer fibers. All properties are calculated from stress-strain curves of 14 fibers for each \nMW. Error bars represent standard deviations, n = 14. (d) Compiled stress-strain curves for all \nfibers tested. \n\nTo gain insight into the origins of the exceptional strength and toughness of 192-mer \nfibers, we examined fiber physical characteristics at both micro and molecular scales. At the \nmicro scale, light microscopy images confirmed that our fibers have consistent diameters along \nthe fiber axes and that diameters do not vary significantly with MW (P = 0.1389, unpaired t test, \nExtended Data Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5). Fiber diameters are also similar to those of \nnatural dragline fibers, which have been reported to range from 1-8 µm (Supplementary Fig. \n5).12,11,14 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed a distinct trend of \ndecreasing surface roughness as well as fewer interior defects with increasing MW (Extended \nFig. 3-5). To quantify this trend, fiber exterior and interior roughness were scored on a scale of \n0-10, and mean roughness from six micrographs for each spidroin MW were calculated (Fig. 3b; \nSupplementary Table 7). By this metric, surface roughness decreased 74% and interior roughness \ndecreased 39% between 96-mer and 192-mer fibers. Meanwhile, a trend of increased circularity \nwith increasing MW is also apparent from the SEM micrographs, with 96-mer fibers exhibiting \nvariations of a tri-lobed structure and 192-mer fibers exhibiting a mostly compact, nearly circular \nmorphology. The average circularity values for 192- and 96-mer fibers were 0.89 (± 0.05) and \n0.55 (± 0.14), with a perfect circle giving a value of 1 (see Methods for calculation) (Fig. 3b; \nSupplementary Table 7). \n\nFigure 3.

Peak intensity ratio at 1670 cm-1 (𝐼𝐼𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋) is presented as an inset. \n168\nTo further investigate fiber characteristics at the molecular scale, the 192-mer fibers were \nanalyzed by polarized Raman microspectroscopy. Deconvolution of the amide I band (16301730 cm-1) of Raman spectra confirm a high percentage (39.7 ± 0.9%) of β-sheet content in the \n192-mer fibers (Fig. 3c), which agrees closely with β-sheet content (37 ± 3%) previously \nreported for natural N. clavipes dragline fibers as determined by both FTIR and polarized \nRaman.15 Meanwhile, several studies have established that dragline fibers exhibit a high degree \nof chain alignment in the axial direction, with β-sheet crystals oriented parallel to the fiber axis—\nan important contributing factor to the exceptional tensile strength of dragline fibers.16,17 Here, \nthe β-sheet alignment along the fiber axis was measured by comparing the amide I β-sheet \ncomponent (1670 cm-1 peak intensities) between spectra acquired from fibers oriented both \nparallel (X-axis) and perpendicular (Y-axis) to the direction of laser polarization (Supplementary \nFig. 6). The 192-mer fibers exhibited a peak intensity ratio (𝐼𝐼\n𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋 ) of 1.42 ± 0.12, which agrees \nclosely to ratios previously reported for natural N. clavipes dragline fibers (1.59).18 Overall, the \nβ-sheet content and alignment observed here confirm that the synthetic 192-mer fibers are \ncapable of recapitulating the structural characteristics of natural spider silk, which likely \ncontributes to its observed mechanical performance. \nTaken together, the synthetic silk fibers produced from our process not only display the \nkey mechanical properties of natural silk but also characteristics including microscale \nmorphology, β-sheet content, and axial alignment of β-sheet crystals. The observed relationship \nbetween spidroin MW and fiber strength suggest that spidroins larger than our 192-mer may \n\nyield synthetic fibers even stronger than natural dragline silks. Additionally, integration of our \nbiosynthetic process with recent advances in biomimetic spinning could further improve fiber \nperformance and process simplification. \nThe fibers produced by this approach may accelerate the development of burgeoning \nmarkets that specifically demand high strength silk fibers, such as projectile protection in defense \nsectors, high strength lightweight cables and ropes in aerospace sectors, or high strength, \nmonofilament, thin fibers (≤ 10 µm) for medical sutures. These applications are especially likely \nwith further improvements in process yield. Moreover, the platform developed here can be easily \nexpanded to other large and highly repetitive material proteins (e.g. collagens, elastins, sucker \nring teeth proteins) for their microbial production from cheap and renewable feedstock. \n199\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at... \n202\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Tavis Reed and Beryl Mpamo for their assistance \nwith protein production; Srikanth Singamaneni, Sirimuvva Tadepalli, and Rohit Gupta for \nassistance with Raman microspectroscopy; and Xiaoxia Xia for suggestions on fiber spinning. \nWe thank the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology for providing the synthetic DNA \nsequence of N. clavipes MaSp1.

For all cloning, E. coli strains were cultured in Terrific Broth \n(TB) containing 24 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L tryptone, 0.4% glycerol, 17 mM KH2PO4, and 72 \nmM K2HPO4 at 37°C with appropriate antibiotics (50 µg/mL kanamycin and 30 µg/mL \nchloramphenicol). M9 glucose medium with tryptone supplement (2% Glucose, 1x M9 Salts, 75 \nmM MOPS pH 7.4, 12 g/L tryptone, 5 mM Citrate, 2 mM MgSO4∙7H2O, 100 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, \n100 µM CaCl2∙2H2O, 3 µM thiamine, 1x micronutrients [40 µM ZnSO4∙7H2O, 20 µM \nCuSO4∙5H2O, 10 µM MnCl2∙4H2O, 4 µM H3BO3, 0.4 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O, and 0.3 µM \nCoCl2∙6H2O]) was used for protein production in bioreactors. \nChemicals and reagents. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were \nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Plasmid purification and gel extraction kits \n\nwere purchased from iNtRON Biotechnology (Lynnwood, WA, USA). FastDigest restriction \nenzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, \nUSA) and used for all digestions and ligations following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. \nGenetic assembly of 64- and 96-mer spidroins. The repeated spidroin DNA sequences \nwere constructed using a method modified from previous work (Supplementary Figure 2). The \ncoding sequence of 1-mer N. clavipes MaSp1 was obtained from Tianjin Institute of Industrial \nBiotechnology (Supplementary Table 1) and chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA \nTechnologies (San Jose, CA, USA). This DNA sequence was flanked on the 5' end by restriction \nsites 5'-KpnI/NheI-3' and on the 3' end by restriction sites 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3'. The sequence was \ninserted between restriction site KpnI/Kpn2I of a medium copy (pBBR1 replication origin) \nchloramphenicol resistance (CmR) expression vector, resulting in plasmid p1. To begin the \niterative DNA assembly, plasmid p1 was linearized by digestion with NheI and ligated with a \nsecond 1-mer sequence digested by NheI/SpeI. The ligation was transformed to NEB10β for \namplification, yielding plasmid p2 containing 2-mer spidroin. The same procedure was repeated \nfor p2, with insertion of a linearized 2-mer sequence, to yield plasmid p4. The process was \nrepeated until p64 (32-mer + 32-mer) and p96 (64-mer + 32-mer) were obtained. Because the \nannealing of the NheI and SpeI complementary overhangs from joining fragments does not \nproduce a new restriction site, digestion with NheI was used to confirm the proper orientation of \nthe insert at each step based on fragment sizes. \nConstruction and sequence optimization of silk-SI-fusion proteins. N- and C-terminal \nSI amino acid sequences (CfaN and CfaC, respectively) were obtained from a recent publication. \nSI coding sequences were optimized for E. coli expression along with 5'UTR and RBS sequences \nusing a combination of computational approaches. Specifically, using the Gene Designer 2.0 \n\n(ATUM) software, a variable CfaC coding sequence was flanked on the 3' end by invariable 5'-\nKpnI/NheI-3' restrictions sites and repetitive silk sequences, and on the 5' end by an invariable \nRBS/5'-UTR (5'-ATCAGCAGGACGCACTGACCGAATTCAAAAGATCTTTTAAGAAGGA \nGATATACAT-3'), including the 5'-EcoRI/BglII-3' restriction sites, and short peptide coding \nsequence 5'-ATGGCTAAGACTAAA-3' (for increased translation initiation rate, as described \npreviously; Supplementary Table 1). Considering these flanking invariable sequences, the \nvariable CfaC sequence was optimized using a modified E. coli codon usage table and giving \nextra weight to 5' mRNA structure minimization during sequence optimization. The resulting \nsequence (Supplementary Table 1) containing the 5'UTR and CfaC was synthesized as a gblock \nfragment by Integrated DNA Technologies and was inserted 5' of the 64-mer or 96-mer \nsequences by digestion/ligation with BglII/KpnI to yield plasmids pC64x and pC96x, which \nencode fusion proteins C64 and C96, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the \nvariable CfaN sequence was flanked on the 5' end by invariable 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3' restrictions sites \nand on the 3' end by an invariable 5'-BamHI/XhoI-3' site and subjected to the same optimization \nprocess as CfaC. The resulting CfaN sequence was synthesized and inserted 3' of the 64-mer and \n96-mer sequences by digestion/ligation with Kpn2I/BamHI to yield plasmids p64N and p96N, \nwhich encode fusion proteins 64N and 96N, respectively. The resulting constructs allow for easy \nswapping of any IntC of interest by digestion with BglII/KpnI and any IntN of interest by \ndigestion with Kpn2I/BamHI, while the presence of NheI/SpeI sites allows for iterative genetic \nassembly of any large or other repetitive material proteins of interest (Supplementary Figure 1). \nUpregulation of GlyV tRNA production. In addition to sequence optimizations, cellular \nglycyltRNA levels were also upregulated to meet the high demands on glycyltRNA posed by \nspidroin overexpression. The glyV tRNA coding sequence and its native promoter were PCR-\n\namplified from the NEB10β genomic DNA (Supplementary Table 1) and cloned between \nAatII/XhoI sites of a medium copy vector carrying p15A replication origin and Kanamycin \nresistance (KanR), yielding plasmid pGlyV (Supplementary Table 2). For all spidroin expression, \npGlyV was co-transformed with the spidroin plasmid. \nShake flask cultures. For initial ligation tests as shown in Supplementary Figures 2 & 4, \nprotein production was carried out in shake flasks. Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 \nmL TB medium at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. Overnight 50 mL cultures were then inoculated \ninto 500 mL fresh TB medium in Erlenmeyer flasks at an initial OD600 = 0.08. Cultures were \ngrown at 37°C with orbital shaking to OD600 = 6, then induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and \ncultured for an additional 6 hours at 30°C with orbital shaking. \nBioproduction in fed-batch bioreactors. All spidroins were finally produced in 2 L fedbatch bioreactors (Bioflo120, Eppendorf). Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 mL TB \nmedium at 37°C on an orbital shaker. The overnight cultures were then inoculated into 1 L \nglucose M9 medium with tryptone supplement with an initial OD600 = 0.08. After overnight \nincubation at 37°C with orbital shaking, 1 L cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g \nfor 10 min and resuspended in 300 mL sterile resuspension medium (250 mM MOPS pH 7.4, \n2.5% glucose, 60 g/L tryptone, 25 mM citrate, 10 mM MgSO4, 500 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, 15 µM \nthiamine, 5x micronutrients). The resuspended cultures were then added to an autoclaved 2 L \nBioflo120 heat-blanketed bioreactor containing 1.2 L water and 1.15x M9 salts. Sterile \nCaCl2∙2H2O was added to a final concertation of 100 µM. Antifoam 204 was added as needed to \nminimize foaming (approximately 0.01%). Agitation and air flow was regulated to maintain \napproximately 70% dissolved oxygen (DO). After consumption of the initial 0.5% glucose (as \njudged by ΔDO), a sterile substrate feed (20% glucose, 48 g/L tryptone, and 10 g/L \n\nMgSO4∙7H2O) was initiated to maintain a linear growth rate. Reactors were induced at OD600 = \n80 by addition of 1 mM IPTG and culture temperature was reduced to 30°C. Cultures were \ncollected four hours after induction. Titers were estimated from densitometric analysis of \nCoomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Figure 3). \nProtein ligation. Cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g for 30 min. \nPellets from complimentary SI-fused spidroins (e.g. 96N and C96 or 64N and C64) were combined \nat a 1:1 reactant ratio based on densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE \ngels. Mixed pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS pH \n7.4, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF) and sonicated using a QSonica Q700 sonicator (Qsonica, \nNewton, CT, USA) for 10 min. Sonicated resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation at \n25,000 x g for 30 min to remove supernatants. Pellets were resuspended in ligation buffer (8 M \nurea, 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP) and stirred at 37°C for 24 h to \ndissolve SI-fused spidroins and allow maximal ligation yield. The mixtures were then \ncentrifuged at 25,000 x g for 1 h to remove cell debris and undissolved proteins. \nProtein purification. The purification protocol was modified from previous methods. \nSpecifically, ligated spidroins in ligation buffer were acidified with acetic acid to pH 4.0. \nAmmonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 1.2 M. The mixture was then \ncentrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and additional ammonia sulfate \nwas added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2.3 M. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture \nwas centrifuged again at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet \nwas resuspended in SEC buffer (8 M urea, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 10) for further \npurification by size-exclusion chromatography. SEC purifications were performed on an AKTA \nPure Chromatography System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-\n\n500 HR column (for 128-mer and 192-mer) or a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column (for \n96-mer). Proteins were separated using an isocratic elution with SEC buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 \nmL/min. Fractions containing greater than 90% ligation product, as determined by SDS-PAGE \ngel densitometry, were collected. SEC-purified fractions were combined and dialyzed in 10K \nMWCO SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientific) against 10 mM acetic acid aqueous \nsolution. The dialyzed samples were then lyophilized. \nLigation kinetics analysis. For kinetics analysis, 64-mer protein concentrations in crude \nlysates were estimated by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. \nBased on estimated concentrations, fully sonicated resuspensions of 64C and N64 in ligation \nbuffer were combined to give final concentrations of 100 µM for both 64C and N64 in a final \nvolume of 500 µL. Combined resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, and pellets were \nresuspended in 500 µL of desired test buffer pre-incubated at the desired test temperature. \nReactions were quenched by transferring 5 µL of reaction to 95 µL of Laemmli sample buffer \npreheated to 100°C and continuing boiling for 10 min. \nSDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis. All SDS-PAGE gels were 1 mm thick, \ndiscontinuous with 3% stacking gel, and hand cast at the indicated percentages. Samples were \nprepared at 1 mg/mL or 5 µM total protein in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, \n60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 100 µM DTT). Gels were run on MiniPROTEAN Tetra Cells (Bio-Rad) in 1x Tris-glycine SDS buffer (25 mM Tris base, 250 mM \nglycine, 0.1% SDS), until just before the dye front exited the gel. Gels were stained in \nCoomassie Blue solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1 g/L Coomassie Brilliant Blue) for a \nminimum of one hour at room temperature with gentle agitation and destained in Coomassie \nBlue destain buffer (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for a minimum of 1 hour. Gels were \n\nimaged on an Azure c600 Imager (Azure Biosystems). All densitometry analysis was performed \nwith the AzureSpot Analysis Software (Azure Biosystems). Images were background subtracted \nwith an automatic valley-to-valley baseline detection. Protein band intensities were integrated by \nthe software. Ligation yield was calculated as the intensity of the product band over the sum of \nboth reactant and product band intensities. Spidroin titer was calculated as the intensity of the \nspidroin band over the sum of all band intensities multiplied by 150 mg/L/OD600 and cell density \nat OD600. (150 mg/L/OD600 is the typical total protein titer in DH10β E. coli cells). \nFiber spinning and mechanical testing. Fiber spinning and mechanical testing were \nperformed following a protocol modified from previous methods. Lyophilized spidroin powders \nwere dissolved in hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to 14% w/v. This protein dope was loaded to a \n100 µL Hamilton gastight syringe (Hamilton Robotics) fitted with a 23s gauge (116 µm inner \ndiameter, 1.71 inch length) needle. The syringe was fitted to a Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite \nsyringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), and the dope was extruded into a 95% methanol bath at 5 \nµL/min (approximately 0.5 m fiber/min). Extruded fibers were then transferred to a 75% \nmethanol bath and carefully extended at approximately 1 cm/s to the maximum draw ratio \nwithout fiber fracture (6x for 96-mer fibers, 9x for 128- and 192-mer fibers). Extended fibers \nwere removed from the bath and held under tension until visibly dry. Segments of post-drawn \nfibers (20 mm) were carefully laid exactly vertical across a 5 mm square opening cut into a 20 \nmm square piece of cardstock and fixed with adhesive tape at both ends of the opening. \nDiameters of mounted fibers were then measured by light microscopy, averaging measurements \nat three points along the fiber axis. Mechanical properties were measured by axial pull tests on \nan MTS Criterion Model 41 universal test frame fitted with a 1N load cell (MTS Systems \nCorporation). Cardstock holders were mounted between two opposing spring-loaded grips, and \n\nthe supporting edges were carefully cut. Pull tests were conducted with a constant crosshead \nspeed of 10 mm/min. Stress-strain curves were recorded by the MTS TW Elite test suite at a \nsampling rate of 50 Hz. Fiber breaks were recorded when a 90% drop from peak stress was \ndetected. All mechanical properties were automatically calculated by the MTS TW Elite test \nsuite. Ultimate tensile strength was calculated as the maximum measured load over the initial \nfiber cross-sectional area (𝐴𝐴= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2), as determined from measured initial diameters. Modulus \nwas calculated as the slope of a linear least squares fit to the stress/strain data of the initial elastic \nregion. Toughness was calculated as the area under the total stress/strain curve divided by the \ninitial fiber volume (𝑉𝑉= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2ℎ) as calculated from measured initial fiber diameters and set initial \ngage length of 5 mm. For each protein, a total of 14 fibers were measured in this manner. \nLight microscopy. Fiber diameters were measured using images acquired with a Zeiss \nAxio Observer ZI Inverted Microscope equipped with a 20x objective lens and the Axiovision \nLE software (Zeiss). For morphological analysis and further confirmation of fiber diameters, \nadditional images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TiE Inverted Microscope equipped with a \n60x objective and analyzed using the Nis-Elements software (Nikon). \nScanning Electron Microscopy. Following tensile tests, silk fibers were mounted onto a \nsample holder using conductive tape. The sample holder was sputter coated with a 10 nm gold \nlayer using a Leica EM ACE600 high vacuum sputter coater (Leica Microsystems). Fibers were \nimaged using a Nova NanoSEM 230 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI) at \nan accelerating voltage of 7-10 kV. Fiber circularity was calculated from cross-sectional areas \nand perimeters as 4𝜋𝜋(\n𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2), where a perfect circle gives a value of 1. \nPolarized Raman microspectroscopy. Silk fibers were carefully fixed to glass \nmicroscope slides with microscale markings to ensure that spectra were acquired at the same \n\nlocation before and after stage rotation. Raman spectra were acquired with a Renishaw RM1000 \nInVia Confocal Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw) coupled to a Leica DM LM microscope with \nrotating stage (Leica Microsystems). Silk fibers were initially oriented along the x-axis as \ndepicted in Supplementary Figure 9. Fibers were irradiated at a fixed point with the 514 nm line \nof an argon laser with polarization fixed along the x-axis and focused through a 50x objective \n(NA = 0.75). Spectra were recorded from 1150-1750 cm-1 with an 1800 lines/mm grating. For \neach acquisition, a total of 16 spectra were accumulated, each for 10 s. The stage was then \nrotated to orient fibers along the y-axis with the same laser polarization, and spectra were \nacquired a second time at the same fixed point. No signs of thermal degradation were apparent \neither visually or within recorded spectra. All recorded spectra were analyzed using the Fityk \n0.9.8 software. Baselines were subtracted from all spectra using the built-in Fityk convex hull \nalgorithm. For secondary structure determination, the amide I peak of y-axis oriented fibers was \ndeconvolved into a set of five gaussian peaks centered at 1641, 1656, 1670, 1685, and 1700 cm-1 \nfor unordered, 31-Helix, β-Sheet, β-Turn, and β-Turn components, respectively, as previously \nreported. Peak areas were integrated and percentages were calculated as the component peak area \nover the sum of all peak areas. Percentages were averaged from measurements of three fibers. \nFor intensity ratio calculations, all spectra were normalized to the intensity of the 1450 cm-1 \npeak, which arises from CH2 bending and is insensitive to protein conformation. For each fiber, \nthe normalized intensity at 1670 cm-1 of the peak oriented along the Y-axis was divided by the \nnormalized intensity of the peak oriented along the x-axis to give the intensity ratio (𝐼𝐼\n𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋). This \nprocedure was performed on a total of three separate fibers and calculated intensity ratios were \naveraged. Spectra were also averaged and presented in Figure 3d with standard deviations for \neach point along the spectra. \n\nTensile \nStrength\nYoung's \nModulus\nSpidroin \nMW. \n(kDa)\nToughness \n(MJ/m3) 1\n(MPa) 1\n(GPa) 1\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\n- \n1215 ±\nDragline\nN. clavipes\nDragline \nAverage**\n1 For all mechanical measurements, n = 14. \n428\nBreaking\nDiamete\nr (µm) 1 \nSource\nStrain\n(%)1\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\n\n430\nExtended Data Figure 1.

Our standardized SI-Brick \nDNA assembly system was developed based on five principle design considerations. (1) The \nsystem should allow for in situ iterative, back-to-back, genetic assembly of material protein \nrepeat motifs up to the maximum genetically-permissible size. (2) The system should allow for \nselective swapping of the three standardized protein parts necessary for post-translational, SImediated ligation (i.e. RBS/IntN, assembled material protein, and IntC/stop codon). (3) No \nrestriction sites within the coding sequence should introduce amino acids likely to be \ndetrimental to SI ligation or protein material properties. (4) For maximum convenience, the \nplatform should allow simultaneous \"one-pot\" assembly of all three protein parts. (5) The \nplatform should also allow for selective swapping of the promoter, antibiotic marker, and \nreplication origin. \n \nWe built our SI-Brick system (Supplementary Figure 1) based on existing BglBrick vectors \nwhich have been extensively used to construct multi-enzyme metabolic pathways for metabolic \nengineering.1 The BglBrick vectors employ BglII and BamHI for digestion/ligation. However, the \nBglII and BamHI enzyme pair cannot be used to assemble material protein fragments because \nthe resulting BglII site would introduce an arginine residue between SI and the material protein, \nproximal to the folded SI active site, which may negatively affect SI ligation, violating our design \ncriterium (3). To solve this problem, we further incorporated an additional and orthogonal pair \nof restriction sites NheI and SpeI for iterative assembly of repetitive material protein \nsequences. NheI and SpeI code amino acids Alanine-Serine and Threonine-Serine, respectively, \nwhich should not affect SI ligation. During repetitive silk assembly, the scar sequence from \nNheI/SpeI ligation is ACTAGC, encoding a Threonine-Serine linker that is abundant in the native \nspidroin sequence and does not affect silk properties. Additionally, because existing BglBricks \nvectors already have SpeI for swapping of selection markers, flanking material proteins with \nNheI/SpeI alone would fail to meet criterium (2). Thus, we chose to flank material protein parts \nwith an additional pair of restriction sites (KpnI and Kpn2I), allowing the repetitive proteins to \nbe specifically swapped by enzyme pair KpnI and Kpn2I.\nTo use our SI-Brick DNA assembly system, repeat material protein motifs can be \niteratively assembled through back-to-back digestion/ligation using NheI and SpeI \n(Supplementary Figure 2). The assembled material protein sequence can then be assembled \nwith desired SI parts, promoters, vector backbones using corresponding restriction enzymes in \none step (Supplementary Figure 2e). When needed, assembled repetitive proteins can be \nswapped with other material proteins with KpnI/Kpn2I digestion/ligation. Cfa IntC (including \nstart codon and RBS) can be swapped with other IntC or N-terminal sequences with EcoRI/KpnI \ndigestion/ligation. Cfa IntN can be swapped with other IntN with or without C-terminal \npurification tags using Kpn2I/BamHI digestion/ligation. Promoter parts can be swapped by \nAatII/EcoRI digestion/ligation, antibiotic markers together with replication origin can be \nswapped by AatII/XhoI. In addition, when needed, other proteins (e.g. a fluorescent reporter \nprotein) can be cloned to the same operon with, but not genetically fused to, material proteins \nfor tracking or regulation purposes using EcoRI/BglII or BamHI/XhoI digestion/ligation.\n\nPrimer/ UTR/\nCoding \nSequence\n3'-UTR \nNA\nCDS \nMaSp1 1mer\nCDS \nCfaN\nCC\nCDS \nCfaC\nPreviously optimized 5' UTR \nincluding strong RBS for high rate\nof translation inititiation\nPreviously optimized 3' UTR \nincluded two strong transcription\nterminators (rrnB T1 and T7Te)\nRestriction site flanked 1-mer for \nassembly of 64-mer and 96-mer\nFinal optimized C-terminal SI \nsequence for assembly with 64-mer \nor 96-mer silk sequences\nCC\nFinal optimized N-terminal SI \nsequence for assembly with 64-mer\nor 96-mer silk sequences\nAmplification of GlyV from E. coli\ngenome and cloning into pAk\nbackbone\nAmplification of GlyV from E. coli\ngenome and cloning into pAk\n\nPlasmid\np64N \npBBR1 \npLlacO1 \nCmR\npC64 \npBBR1 \npLlacO1 \nCmR\np96N \npBBR1 \npLlacO1 \nCmR\npC96 \npBBR1 \npLlacO1 \nCmR\npGlyV \np15A \nNative glyV,X,Y \npromoter \nKanR\n\nSource\nstudy\n64-mer + \noptimized 3'\nPresent \nstudy\nCfaN\n64-mer + \noptimized 5'\nPresent \nstudy\nCfaC\n96-mer + \noptimized 3'\nPresent \nstudy\nCfaN\n96-mer + \noptimized 5'\nPresent \nstudy\nCfaC\nJBE \nBioBrick\npaper\nNative E.\ncoli glyV \nand \npromoter\nPresent \nstudy\n\nSupplementary Table 3.

Fibers spun \nfrom these synthetic spidroins display ultimate tensile strength (σ), modulus (E), \nextensibility (ε), and toughness (UT) of 1.03 ± 0.11 GPa, 13.7 ± 3.0 GPa, 18 ± 6%, and 114 ± \n51 MJ/m3, respectively—equivalent to the performance of natural N. clavipes dragline silk.6 \nThis work demonstrates for the first time that microbially produced synthetic silk fibers \ncan match the performance of natural silk fibers by all common metrics (σ, E, ε, UT), \nproviding a more dependable source of high-strength fibers to replace natural spider silks \nfor mechanically demanding applications. Furthermore, our biosynthetic platform can be \npotentially expanded for the assembly and production of other protein-based materials \nwith high MW and repetitive sequences that have so far been impossible to synthesize by \ngenetic means alone. \n46\n\nMain Text: \nDragline spidroins are typically very large (200-350 kDa), highly repetitive proteins, \ncontaining hundreds of tandem repeats of glycine and alanine-rich sequences.1,7 As with most \npolymers, the size of these spidroins is expected to positively correlate with tensile strength due \nto an increased density of interchain interactions and entanglements and fewer chain-end \ndefects.8,5 Indeed, previous work has demonstrated a clear correlation between MW and strength \nfor recombinant N. clavipes dragline fibers, with the largest spidroin (96-mer, 285 kDa) yielding \nthe strongest recombinant fiber reported to date (~550 MPa).5 However, despite the apparent \nneed for even larger spidroins to yield natural strength fibers (1.1 GPa for N. clavipes dragline)6, \ndragline spidroins larger than 285 kDa have yet to be produced in quantities sufficient for fiber \ntesting due to major challenges in recombinant production of high MW spidroins (e.g. instability \nof long, highly repetitive DNA/mRNA sequences in heterologous hosts, translation inhibition by \ncomplex mRNA secondary structures, high demands for glycine and alanine tRNAs, overall \nmetabolic burden).5 \n62\n\nFigure 1. Process schematic for split intein-mediated ligation of spider silk proteins with \nunprecedented molecular weight and mechanical properties. (a) The highly repetitive core of \nnatural N. clavipes dragline silk protein MaSp1 (shown as an idealized peptide sequence) is \nreduced to a single repeat unit (1-mer). (b) The 1-mer DNA sequence is combined in silico with \n5' UTR, RBS, and split intein (SI) sequences, which are then computationally optimized for \nmicrobial production. (c) The optimized DNA sequences are assembled through our \nstandardized SI-Brick system to yield complementary IntC- or IntN-flanked 96-mer constructs \nwhich are (d) transformed to E. coli for bioproduction. (e) Cell cultures are mixed and lysed to \ninitiate SI-mediated covalent ligation of 96-mer spidroins to yield a 192-mer, 556 kDa product. \n(f) Ligated product is purified and spun into fibers for mechanical testing. Scale bar indicates 5 \nµm. \n76\nTo confront these challenges, we envisioned using split intein (SI)-mediated reactions to \npost-translationally ligate the largest spidroins that can be stably expressed in engineered \nEscherichia coli (i.e. 96-mer, Fig. 1). SIs are peptide auto processing domains that, when fused \n\nto separately expressed proteins, catalyze spontaneous splicing reactions, covalently linking their \nfusion partners via a peptide bond and leaving only a few residues (6 amino acids in this case) at \nthe ligation site.9 In this context, these residues are unlikely to affect the properties of the much \nlarger ligated spidroins (6720 amino acids). Given the tendency of large silk sequences to form \ninclusion bodies in microbial hosts, we employed a recently engineered SI pair (Cfa) that retains \ncatalytic activity in the presence of 8 M urea, a denaturant often used to extract and solubilize \nspidroins from heterologous hosts.10 Thus, ligating an N-intein fused 96-mer (N96) with a Cintein fused 96-mer (96C) spidroin would yield a 556 kDa, 192-mer spidroin (Fig 1e). \nTo facilitate microbial production of highly repetitive, SI-fused material proteins, we \ndeveloped a standardized DNA assembly strategy, termed SI-Bricks (Supplementary Note 1 and \nFigure 1). The SI-Bricks strategy allows for rapid genetic swapping of the core components of \nthe devised SI-mediated ligation system (e.g. N-inteins, material proteins, C-inteins, and fusion \ndomains/purification tags) in addition to common standardized biological parts (e.g. promoters, \nribosomal binding sites, replication origins, and selection markers), all through simple restriction \nenzyme digestion/ligations. With SI-Bricks, starting from a single codon-optimized repeat unit \n(1-mer) of the N. clavipes dragline spidroin MaSp1, we assembled 64-mer and 96-mer spidroin \nDNA sequences by iterative end-to-end restriction digestion/ligation. The spidroin sequences \nwere then genetically combined with codon-optimized SI DNA sequences and expression parts \n(Supplementary Figure 2). The resulting SI-fused spidroins (N64, 64C, N96, and 96C) were \nindividually expressed in an E. coli host with glycyltRNA levels engineered to meet the demands \nof the most frequently used glycine codons in the spidroin sequences (Methods). Following our \noptimized fermentation conditions (Methods), typical titer of the SI-fused spidroins was nearly 2 \n\ng/L from glucose minimal medium with tryptone supplementation after four hours of production \n(Supplementary Figure 3). \nSpidroin inter- and intramolecular interactions are highly sensitive to salt and pH, even in \nthe presence of 8 M urea, and we expected that unwanted spidroin interactions would lower SI \nligation efficiency. Thus, to test optimum conditions for ligation of SI-fused spidroins, 8 M urea \nextracts of E. coli expressing 64N or C64 were mixed at several salt concentrations, temperatures, \nand pH values (Extended Data Figure 1). Under all tested conditions, SI-mediated spidroin \nligation is both rapid and robust, with the highest ligation yields observed at 37 °C, 300 mM \nNaCl, pH 7. Thus, for all subsequent ligations, these conditions were maintained, giving ligation \nyields of 68% and 62% for 128-mer and 192-mer spidroin, respectively (Extended Figure Data \nFigure 2). Ligation products were separated from most cellular proteins by selective precipitation \nwith ammonium sulfate and further separated from unreacted 64-mer or 96-mer by size \nexclusion chromatography (SEC) for a final product purity ≥90% (Supplementary Fig. 4). As a \nstandard for mechanical properties, a 96-mer spidroin with no SIs was also expressed and \npurified following identical procedures. All purified proteins were lyophilized and dissolved in \nhexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to yield 14% w/v spinning dopes which were wet-spun into solid \nfibers by extrusion into a 95% methanol bath followed by immediate post-spin drawing. \nMechanical testing of post-drawn fibers revealed significant, nearly two-fold increases in \nboth tensile strength (from 525 ± 83 MPa to 1031 ± 111 MPa, P < 0.0001, n=14) and modulus \n(from 7.8 ± 1.3 GPa to 13.7 ± 3.0 GPa, P < 0.0001, n=14) between 96-mer and 192-mer fibers \n(Fig. 2a,b). Average toughness also increased slightly (25%), while average breaking strain \ndecreased slightly (22%), though neither change is statistically significant due to large fiber to \nfiber variations (Fig. 2c, d). For both strength and modulus, 128-mer fibers showed performance \n\nintermediate to 96- and 192-mer fibers. Together, these results strongly suggest that there \nremains a positive correlation between spidroin size and fiber strength and modulus up to a MW \nof at least 556 kDa. Most significantly, these results demonstrate that fibers spun from a \nmicrobially synthesized 192-mer N. clavipes dragline spidroin have mechanical properties \nequivalent to natural N. clavipes dragline silk (i.e., σ = 993 ± 140 GPa, E = 14.0 ± 4.0 GPa, UT = \n111.2 ± 30 MJ/m3, ε = 16.3 ±3.8%, Extended Data Table 1).6,11,12,13 \n131\nFigure 2. Mechanical properties of synthetic silk fibers from high MW spidroins. (a) Ultimate \ntensile strength, (b) elastic modulus, (c) breaking strain, and (d) toughness of 96-mer, 128-mer, \nand 192-mer fibers. All properties are calculated from stress-strain curves of 14 fibers for each \nMW. Error bars represent standard deviations, n = 14. (d) Compiled stress-strain curves for all \nfibers tested. \n\nTo gain insight into the origins of the exceptional strength and toughness of 192-mer \nfibers, we examined fiber physical characteristics at both micro and molecular scales. At the \nmicro scale, light microscopy images confirmed that our fibers have consistent diameters along \nthe fiber axes and that diameters do not vary significantly with MW (P = 0.1389, unpaired t test, \nExtended Data Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5). Fiber diameters are also similar to those of \nnatural dragline fibers, which have been reported to range from 1-8 µm (Supplementary Fig. \n5).12,11,14 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed a distinct trend of \ndecreasing surface roughness as well as fewer interior defects with increasing MW (Extended \nFig. 3-5). To quantify this trend, fiber exterior and interior roughness were scored on a scale of \n0-10, and mean roughness from six micrographs for each spidroin MW were calculated (Fig. 3b; \nSupplementary Table 7). By this metric, surface roughness decreased 74% and interior roughness \ndecreased 39% between 96-mer and 192-mer fibers. Meanwhile, a trend of increased circularity \nwith increasing MW is also apparent from the SEM micrographs, with 96-mer fibers exhibiting \nvariations of a tri-lobed structure and 192-mer fibers exhibiting a mostly compact, nearly circular \nmorphology. The average circularity values for 192- and 96-mer fibers were 0.89 (± 0.05) and \n0.55 (± 0.14), with a perfect circle giving a value of 1 (see Methods for calculation) (Fig. 3b; \nSupplementary Table 7). \n\nFigure 3. Fiber characteristics at micro and molecular scales. (a) Representative SEM \nmicrograph of a 192-mer fiber showing nearly circular cross-section, with smooth surface and \ndense, relatively smooth interior morphology similar to natural dragline fibers. Scale bar is 5 \nµm. (b) Quantification of fiber circularity, surface roughness and interior roughness, showing \ngeneral trend of increasing circularity and decreasing roughness with increased fiber MW. \nMeasures are from micrographs presented in Extended Data Figure 3-5. (c) Representative \namide I band deconvolution and secondary structure quantification for 192-mer fibers showing \nβ-sheet content similar to natural dragline fibers. (d) Amide I Raman spectra for 192-mer fibers \noriented parallel (blue lines) or perpendicular (red lines) to the direction of laser polarization. \nAs expected for anisoptropic fibers with axial β-sheet crystal alignment, Amide I peak intensity \n\nincreases when fibers are oriented perpendicular to laser polarization (Supplementary Figure \n6). Peak intensity ratio at 1670 cm-1 (𝐼𝐼𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋) is presented as an inset. \n168\nTo further investigate fiber characteristics at the molecular scale, the 192-mer fibers were \nanalyzed by polarized Raman microspectroscopy. Deconvolution of the amide I band (16301730 cm-1) of Raman spectra confirm a high percentage (39.7 ± 0.9%) of β-sheet content in the \n192-mer fibers (Fig. 3c), which agrees closely with β-sheet content (37 ± 3%) previously \nreported for natural N. clavipes dragline fibers as determined by both FTIR and polarized \nRaman.15 Meanwhile, several studies have established that dragline fibers exhibit a high degree \nof chain alignment in the axial direction, with β-sheet crystals oriented parallel to the fiber axis—\nan important contributing factor to the exceptional tensile strength of dragline fibers.16,17 Here, \nthe β-sheet alignment along the fiber axis was measured by comparing the amide I β-sheet \ncomponent (1670 cm-1 peak intensities) between spectra acquired from fibers oriented both \nparallel (X-axis) and perpendicular (Y-axis) to the direction of laser polarization (Supplementary \nFig. 6). The 192-mer fibers exhibited a peak intensity ratio (𝐼𝐼\n𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋 ) of 1.42 ± 0.12, which agrees \nclosely to ratios previously reported for natural N. clavipes dragline fibers (1.59).18 Overall, the \nβ-sheet content and alignment observed here confirm that the synthetic 192-mer fibers are \ncapable of recapitulating the structural characteristics of natural spider silk, which likely \ncontributes to its observed mechanical performance. \nTaken together, the synthetic silk fibers produced from our process not only display the \nkey mechanical properties of natural silk but also characteristics including microscale \nmorphology, β-sheet content, and axial alignment of β-sheet crystals. The observed relationship \nbetween spidroin MW and fiber strength suggest that spidroins larger than our 192-mer may \n\nyield synthetic fibers even stronger than natural dragline silks. Additionally, integration of our \nbiosynthetic process with recent advances in biomimetic spinning could further improve fiber \nperformance and process simplification. \nThe fibers produced by this approach may accelerate the development of burgeoning \nmarkets that specifically demand high strength silk fibers, such as projectile protection in defense \nsectors, high strength lightweight cables and ropes in aerospace sectors, or high strength, \nmonofilament, thin fibers (≤ 10 µm) for medical sutures. These applications are especially likely \nwith further improvements in process yield. Moreover, the platform developed here can be easily \nexpanded to other large and highly repetitive material proteins (e.g. collagens, elastins, sucker \nring teeth proteins) for their microbial production from cheap and renewable feedstock. \n199\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at... \n202\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Tavis Reed and Beryl Mpamo for their assistance \nwith protein production; Srikanth Singamaneni, Sirimuvva Tadepalli, and Rohit Gupta for \nassistance with Raman microspectroscopy; and Xiaoxia Xia for suggestions on fiber spinning. \nWe thank the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology for providing the synthetic DNA \nsequence of N. clavipes MaSp1.

For all cloning, E. coli strains were cultured in Terrific Broth \n(TB) containing 24 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L tryptone, 0.4% glycerol, 17 mM KH2PO4, and 72 \nmM K2HPO4 at 37°C with appropriate antibiotics (50 µg/mL kanamycin and 30 µg/mL \nchloramphenicol). M9 glucose medium with tryptone supplement (2% Glucose, 1x M9 Salts, 75 \nmM MOPS pH 7.4, 12 g/L tryptone, 5 mM Citrate, 2 mM MgSO4∙7H2O, 100 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, \n100 µM CaCl2∙2H2O, 3 µM thiamine, 1x micronutrients [40 µM ZnSO4∙7H2O, 20 µM \nCuSO4∙5H2O, 10 µM MnCl2∙4H2O, 4 µM H3BO3, 0.4 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O, and 0.3 µM \nCoCl2∙6H2O]) was used for protein production in bioreactors. \nChemicals and reagents. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were \nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Plasmid purification and gel extraction kits \n\nwere purchased from iNtRON Biotechnology (Lynnwood, WA, USA). FastDigest restriction \nenzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, \nUSA) and used for all digestions and ligations following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. \nGenetic assembly of 64- and 96-mer spidroins. The repeated spidroin DNA sequences \nwere constructed using a method modified from previous work (Supplementary Figure 2). The \ncoding sequence of 1-mer N. clavipes MaSp1 was obtained from Tianjin Institute of Industrial \nBiotechnology (Supplementary Table 1) and chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA \nTechnologies (San Jose, CA, USA). This DNA sequence was flanked on the 5' end by restriction \nsites 5'-KpnI/NheI-3' and on the 3' end by restriction sites 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3'. The sequence was \ninserted between restriction site KpnI/Kpn2I of a medium copy (pBBR1 replication origin) \nchloramphenicol resistance (CmR) expression vector, resulting in plasmid p1. To begin the \niterative DNA assembly, plasmid p1 was linearized by digestion with NheI and ligated with a \nsecond 1-mer sequence digested by NheI/SpeI. The ligation was transformed to NEB10β for \namplification, yielding plasmid p2 containing 2-mer spidroin. The same procedure was repeated \nfor p2, with insertion of a linearized 2-mer sequence, to yield plasmid p4. The process was \nrepeated until p64 (32-mer + 32-mer) and p96 (64-mer + 32-mer) were obtained. Because the \nannealing of the NheI and SpeI complementary overhangs from joining fragments does not \nproduce a new restriction site, digestion with NheI was used to confirm the proper orientation of \nthe insert at each step based on fragment sizes. \nConstruction and sequence optimization of silk-SI-fusion proteins. N- and C-terminal \nSI amino acid sequences (CfaN and CfaC, respectively) were obtained from a recent publication. \nSI coding sequences were optimized for E. coli expression along with 5'UTR and RBS sequences \nusing a combination of computational approaches. Specifically, using the Gene Designer 2.0 \n\n(ATUM) software, a variable CfaC coding sequence was flanked on the 3' end by invariable 5'-\nKpnI/NheI-3' restrictions sites and repetitive silk sequences, and on the 5' end by an invariable \nRBS/5'-UTR (5'-ATCAGCAGGACGCACTGACCGAATTCAAAAGATCTTTTAAGAAGGA \nGATATACAT-3'), including the 5'-EcoRI/BglII-3' restriction sites, and short peptide coding \nsequence 5'-ATGGCTAAGACTAAA-3' (for increased translation initiation rate, as described \npreviously; Supplementary Table 1). Considering these flanking invariable sequences, the \nvariable CfaC sequence was optimized using a modified E. coli codon usage table and giving \nextra weight to 5' mRNA structure minimization during sequence optimization. The resulting \nsequence (Supplementary Table 1) containing the 5'UTR and CfaC was synthesized as a gblock \nfragment by Integrated DNA Technologies and was inserted 5' of the 64-mer or 96-mer \nsequences by digestion/ligation with BglII/KpnI to yield plasmids pC64x and pC96x, which \nencode fusion proteins C64 and C96, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the \nvariable CfaN sequence was flanked on the 5' end by invariable 5'-SpeI/Kpn2I-3' restrictions sites \nand on the 3' end by an invariable 5'-BamHI/XhoI-3' site and subjected to the same optimization \nprocess as CfaC. The resulting CfaN sequence was synthesized and inserted 3' of the 64-mer and \n96-mer sequences by digestion/ligation with Kpn2I/BamHI to yield plasmids p64N and p96N, \nwhich encode fusion proteins 64N and 96N, respectively. The resulting constructs allow for easy \nswapping of any IntC of interest by digestion with BglII/KpnI and any IntN of interest by \ndigestion with Kpn2I/BamHI, while the presence of NheI/SpeI sites allows for iterative genetic \nassembly of any large or other repetitive material proteins of interest (Supplementary Figure 1). \nUpregulation of GlyV tRNA production. In addition to sequence optimizations, cellular \nglycyltRNA levels were also upregulated to meet the high demands on glycyltRNA posed by \nspidroin overexpression. The glyV tRNA coding sequence and its native promoter were PCR-\n\namplified from the NEB10β genomic DNA (Supplementary Table 1) and cloned between \nAatII/XhoI sites of a medium copy vector carrying p15A replication origin and Kanamycin \nresistance (KanR), yielding plasmid pGlyV (Supplementary Table 2). For all spidroin expression, \npGlyV was co-transformed with the spidroin plasmid. \nShake flask cultures. For initial ligation tests as shown in Supplementary Figures 2 & 4, \nprotein production was carried out in shake flasks. Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 \nmL TB medium at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. Overnight 50 mL cultures were then inoculated \ninto 500 mL fresh TB medium in Erlenmeyer flasks at an initial OD600 = 0.08. Cultures were \ngrown at 37°C with orbital shaking to OD600 = 6, then induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and \ncultured for an additional 6 hours at 30°C with orbital shaking. \nBioproduction in fed-batch bioreactors. All spidroins were finally produced in 2 L fedbatch bioreactors (Bioflo120, Eppendorf). Transformants were cultured overnight in 50 mL TB \nmedium at 37°C on an orbital shaker. The overnight cultures were then inoculated into 1 L \nglucose M9 medium with tryptone supplement with an initial OD600 = 0.08. After overnight \nincubation at 37°C with orbital shaking, 1 L cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g \nfor 10 min and resuspended in 300 mL sterile resuspension medium (250 mM MOPS pH 7.4, \n2.5% glucose, 60 g/L tryptone, 25 mM citrate, 10 mM MgSO4, 500 µM FeSO4∙7H2O, 15 µM \nthiamine, 5x micronutrients). The resuspended cultures were then added to an autoclaved 2 L \nBioflo120 heat-blanketed bioreactor containing 1.2 L water and 1.15x M9 salts. Sterile \nCaCl2∙2H2O was added to a final concertation of 100 µM. Antifoam 204 was added as needed to \nminimize foaming (approximately 0.01%). Agitation and air flow was regulated to maintain \napproximately 70% dissolved oxygen (DO). After consumption of the initial 0.5% glucose (as \njudged by ΔDO), a sterile substrate feed (20% glucose, 48 g/L tryptone, and 10 g/L \n\nMgSO4∙7H2O) was initiated to maintain a linear growth rate. Reactors were induced at OD600 = \n80 by addition of 1 mM IPTG and culture temperature was reduced to 30°C. Cultures were \ncollected four hours after induction. Titers were estimated from densitometric analysis of \nCoomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Figure 3). \nProtein ligation. Cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 x g for 30 min. \nPellets from complimentary SI-fused spidroins (e.g. 96N and C96 or 64N and C64) were combined \nat a 1:1 reactant ratio based on densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE \ngels. Mixed pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS pH \n7.4, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF) and sonicated using a QSonica Q700 sonicator (Qsonica, \nNewton, CT, USA) for 10 min. Sonicated resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation at \n25,000 x g for 30 min to remove supernatants. Pellets were resuspended in ligation buffer (8 M \nurea, 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP) and stirred at 37°C for 24 h to \ndissolve SI-fused spidroins and allow maximal ligation yield. The mixtures were then \ncentrifuged at 25,000 x g for 1 h to remove cell debris and undissolved proteins. \nProtein purification. The purification protocol was modified from previous methods. \nSpecifically, ligated spidroins in ligation buffer were acidified with acetic acid to pH 4.0. \nAmmonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 1.2 M. The mixture was then \ncentrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and additional ammonia sulfate \nwas added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2.3 M. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture \nwas centrifuged again at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet \nwas resuspended in SEC buffer (8 M urea, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 10) for further \npurification by size-exclusion chromatography. SEC purifications were performed on an AKTA \nPure Chromatography System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-\n\n500 HR column (for 128-mer and 192-mer) or a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column (for \n96-mer). Proteins were separated using an isocratic elution with SEC buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 \nmL/min. Fractions containing greater than 90% ligation product, as determined by SDS-PAGE \ngel densitometry, were collected. SEC-purified fractions were combined and dialyzed in 10K \nMWCO SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientific) against 10 mM acetic acid aqueous \nsolution. The dialyzed samples were then lyophilized. \nLigation kinetics analysis. For kinetics analysis, 64-mer protein concentrations in crude \nlysates were estimated by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. \nBased on estimated concentrations, fully sonicated resuspensions of 64C and N64 in ligation \nbuffer were combined to give final concentrations of 100 µM for both 64C and N64 in a final \nvolume of 500 µL. Combined resuspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, and pellets were \nresuspended in 500 µL of desired test buffer pre-incubated at the desired test temperature. \nReactions were quenched by transferring 5 µL of reaction to 95 µL of Laemmli sample buffer \npreheated to 100°C and continuing boiling for 10 min. \nSDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis. All SDS-PAGE gels were 1 mm thick, \ndiscontinuous with 3% stacking gel, and hand cast at the indicated percentages. Samples were \nprepared at 1 mg/mL or 5 µM total protein in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, \n60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 100 µM DTT). Gels were run on MiniPROTEAN Tetra Cells (Bio-Rad) in 1x Tris-glycine SDS buffer (25 mM Tris base, 250 mM \nglycine, 0.1% SDS), until just before the dye front exited the gel. Gels were stained in \nCoomassie Blue solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1 g/L Coomassie Brilliant Blue) for a \nminimum of one hour at room temperature with gentle agitation and destained in Coomassie \nBlue destain buffer (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for a minimum of 1 hour. Gels were \n\nimaged on an Azure c600 Imager (Azure Biosystems). All densitometry analysis was performed \nwith the AzureSpot Analysis Software (Azure Biosystems). Images were background subtracted \nwith an automatic valley-to-valley baseline detection. Protein band intensities were integrated by \nthe software. Ligation yield was calculated as the intensity of the product band over the sum of \nboth reactant and product band intensities. Spidroin titer was calculated as the intensity of the \nspidroin band over the sum of all band intensities multiplied by 150 mg/L/OD600 and cell density \nat OD600. (150 mg/L/OD600 is the typical total protein titer in DH10β E. coli cells). \nFiber spinning and mechanical testing. Fiber spinning and mechanical testing were \nperformed following a protocol modified from previous methods. Lyophilized spidroin powders \nwere dissolved in hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to 14% w/v. This protein dope was loaded to a \n100 µL Hamilton gastight syringe (Hamilton Robotics) fitted with a 23s gauge (116 µm inner \ndiameter, 1.71 inch length) needle. The syringe was fitted to a Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite \nsyringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), and the dope was extruded into a 95% methanol bath at 5 \nµL/min (approximately 0.5 m fiber/min). Extruded fibers were then transferred to a 75% \nmethanol bath and carefully extended at approximately 1 cm/s to the maximum draw ratio \nwithout fiber fracture (6x for 96-mer fibers, 9x for 128- and 192-mer fibers). Extended fibers \nwere removed from the bath and held under tension until visibly dry. Segments of post-drawn \nfibers (20 mm) were carefully laid exactly vertical across a 5 mm square opening cut into a 20 \nmm square piece of cardstock and fixed with adhesive tape at both ends of the opening. \nDiameters of mounted fibers were then measured by light microscopy, averaging measurements \nat three points along the fiber axis. Mechanical properties were measured by axial pull tests on \nan MTS Criterion Model 41 universal test frame fitted with a 1N load cell (MTS Systems \nCorporation). Cardstock holders were mounted between two opposing spring-loaded grips, and \n\nthe supporting edges were carefully cut. Pull tests were conducted with a constant crosshead \nspeed of 10 mm/min. Stress-strain curves were recorded by the MTS TW Elite test suite at a \nsampling rate of 50 Hz. Fiber breaks were recorded when a 90% drop from peak stress was \ndetected. All mechanical properties were automatically calculated by the MTS TW Elite test \nsuite. Ultimate tensile strength was calculated as the maximum measured load over the initial \nfiber cross-sectional area (𝐴𝐴= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2), as determined from measured initial diameters. Modulus \nwas calculated as the slope of a linear least squares fit to the stress/strain data of the initial elastic \nregion. Toughness was calculated as the area under the total stress/strain curve divided by the \ninitial fiber volume (𝑉𝑉= 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟2ℎ) as calculated from measured initial fiber diameters and set initial \ngage length of 5 mm. For each protein, a total of 14 fibers were measured in this manner. \nLight microscopy. Fiber diameters were measured using images acquired with a Zeiss \nAxio Observer ZI Inverted Microscope equipped with a 20x objective lens and the Axiovision \nLE software (Zeiss). For morphological analysis and further confirmation of fiber diameters, \nadditional images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TiE Inverted Microscope equipped with a \n60x objective and analyzed using the Nis-Elements software (Nikon). \nScanning Electron Microscopy. Following tensile tests, silk fibers were mounted onto a \nsample holder using conductive tape. The sample holder was sputter coated with a 10 nm gold \nlayer using a Leica EM ACE600 high vacuum sputter coater (Leica Microsystems). Fibers were \nimaged using a Nova NanoSEM 230 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI) at \nan accelerating voltage of 7-10 kV. Fiber circularity was calculated from cross-sectional areas \nand perimeters as 4𝜋𝜋(\n𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2), where a perfect circle gives a value of 1. \nPolarized Raman microspectroscopy. Silk fibers were carefully fixed to glass \nmicroscope slides with microscale markings to ensure that spectra were acquired at the same \n\nlocation before and after stage rotation. Raman spectra were acquired with a Renishaw RM1000 \nInVia Confocal Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw) coupled to a Leica DM LM microscope with \nrotating stage (Leica Microsystems). Silk fibers were initially oriented along the x-axis as \ndepicted in Supplementary Figure 9. Fibers were irradiated at a fixed point with the 514 nm line \nof an argon laser with polarization fixed along the x-axis and focused through a 50x objective \n(NA = 0.75). Spectra were recorded from 1150-1750 cm-1 with an 1800 lines/mm grating. For \neach acquisition, a total of 16 spectra were accumulated, each for 10 s. The stage was then \nrotated to orient fibers along the y-axis with the same laser polarization, and spectra were \nacquired a second time at the same fixed point. No signs of thermal degradation were apparent \neither visually or within recorded spectra. All recorded spectra were analyzed using the Fityk \n0.9.8 software. Baselines were subtracted from all spectra using the built-in Fityk convex hull \nalgorithm. For secondary structure determination, the amide I peak of y-axis oriented fibers was \ndeconvolved into a set of five gaussian peaks centered at 1641, 1656, 1670, 1685, and 1700 cm-1 \nfor unordered, 31-Helix, β-Sheet, β-Turn, and β-Turn components, respectively, as previously \nreported. Peak areas were integrated and percentages were calculated as the component peak area \nover the sum of all peak areas. Percentages were averaged from measurements of three fibers. \nFor intensity ratio calculations, all spectra were normalized to the intensity of the 1450 cm-1 \npeak, which arises from CH2 bending and is insensitive to protein conformation. For each fiber, \nthe normalized intensity at 1670 cm-1 of the peak oriented along the Y-axis was divided by the \nnormalized intensity of the peak oriented along the x-axis to give the intensity ratio (𝐼𝐼\n𝑌𝑌\n𝑋𝑋). This \nprocedure was performed on a total of three separate fibers and calculated intensity ratios were \naveraged. Spectra were also averaged and presented in Figure 3d with standard deviations for \neach point along the spectra. \n\nTensile \nStrength\nYoung's \nModulus\nSpidroin \nMW. \n(kDa)\nToughness \n(MJ/m3) 1\n(MPa) 1\n(GPa) 1\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nSynthetic\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\nDragline\nNatural \nN. clavipes\n- \n1215 ±\nDragline\nN. clavipes\nDragline \nAverage**\n1 For all mechanical measurements, n = 14. \n428\nBreaking\nDiamete\nr (µm) 1 \nSource\nStrain\n(%)1\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\nCunniff 1994 \n(Adapted from\n\n430\nExtended Data Figure 1.
