I'm afraid the provided text does not contain explicit causal relationships between defined entities within materials science. There are mentions of 'spidroin sequences' and 'species' in the context of a biological study, but they do not relate in a manner fitting the specified relationship types in materials science terms. Therefore, no structured causal relationships can be extracted from this text as per the given instructions.
